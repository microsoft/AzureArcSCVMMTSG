**Explanation**

During Azure Arc resource bridge (ARB) deployment on a SCVMM managed datacenter, a remote PowerShell session creation request triggers from the workstation machine from which the deployment script is executed to the VMM server machine. The user will be prompted to provide a Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) which can be rolename/nodename or an IP address.

Get-SCVMMServer failure error can be encountered because of multiple reasons. Given below is one of the reasons and the recommended steps to confirm the same:

1) There is no VMM Service running as part of the specified FQDN or IP address to connect to the VMM server.

For a standalone VMM setup, either the full FQDN of the VMM server machine or the IP address needs to be specified. For a highly available (HA) VMM setup, we can either specify the HAVMM role name or the active node's FQDN or IP address. To validate this, 
- RDP inside the VMM server machine using the FQDN or the IP address which was specified for ARB VM deployment
- Open the service pane to check the running services (services.msc)
- Check if SCVMMService is running.

Once the service is up and running, run the below command from the workstation machine to ensure the creation of a PowerShell session and then proceed with the execution of the ARB VM deployment script.

     **New-PSSession -ComputerName <fqdn/IP> -Authentication Negotiate -Credential 'domain\username'**
