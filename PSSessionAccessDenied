  failed to get new provider:  SCVMM PSSession creation failed. Please check if the specfied username and password are correct.

For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.

**Explanation**

During the Azure Arc resource bridge deployment (ARB) on a SCVMM managed datacenter, a remote PowerShell session creation request triggers from the workstation machine from which the deployment script is executed to the VMM server machine. The user will be prompted to provide a Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) which can be rolename/nodename or an IP.

Access denied error can be seen because of multiple reasons. Given below are some of the reasons and recommended steps to confirm the same:

1) The user account (say domain\username) used to create the remote session is not an administrator in the VMM server machine. To validate this,
   - RDP into the VMM server machine.
   - Search for lusrmgr.msc
   - Go to Group->Administrators and check if the account used during the execution of the ARB deployment script is added here
   - Open a PowerShell admininstrator prompt from the workstation machine and run the below command

     **New-PSSession -ComputerName <fqdn/IP> -Authentication Negotiate -Credential 'domain\username'**

2) Username or password provided is incorrect. To validate this, open a PowerShell admininstrator prompt from the workstation machine and run the below command

     **New-PSSession -ComputerName <fqdn/IP> -Authentication Negotiate -Credential 'domain\username'**
